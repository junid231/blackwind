this program is used to guess PI by Buffon's needle:

  l : length of needle
  d : distance between parallel lines
  n : attempts to throw needles

  tried : number of needles that cross the line
  x : distance between center point of needle and the nearest parallel line
  theta : angle between needle and parallel line (radians)
  p: simulated probability

guess : approximation of PI
